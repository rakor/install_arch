A little script to install Arch-Linux on zfs with zfsbootmanager.

* prepare the partiotions needed for EFI-boot
* create an encrypted zpool and zfs-datasets
* install zfsbootmenu as bootmanager
* install Gnome as Desktop
* create an useraccount

This is a personal script for my own needs.

Some things to do....
* more comments
* include microcode-updates
